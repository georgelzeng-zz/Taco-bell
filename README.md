# TacoBell Calorie Optimizer

This project was inspired by Alex Nguyen. He did a similar project featuring just calorie optimization at McDonald's.


As someone looking to gain weight, the best strategy is to eat more. However, eating more calories means spending more, and sometimes, eating more fat. 


Presenting, the TacoBell Calorie Optimizer. Users can enter an amount of fat, and a budget, and this app will calculate the most calorie dense meal that you can purchase with less than the given amount of fat.

Prices: https://www.fastfoodmenuprices.com/taco-bell-prices/. I used the prices in California, since I am a Berkeley student. 

Nutrition Facts: https://fastfoodnutrition.org/taco-bell/chart. I only included items that also had prices. Therefore, sauces and mountain dew not included. Sorry!
